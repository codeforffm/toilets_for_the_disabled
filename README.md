# Toilets for the Disabled in Frankfurt

Currently there's only a scraper, getting detailed data on locations with accessible toilets.

The plan is to put that data into openstreetmap.org and possibly into a dedicated mobile and web app.

Next/open steps:
* Pushing the data to OSM via their API
* App for spotting
* Web App showing the spotted POIs
* Web API  for accepting POIs spotted by the API

Run with

	ruby toilets_for_the_disabled.rb
